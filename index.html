        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>After graduating college I was confused on what I wanted my career to be and started             working for my brothers restoration company. I started learning about web development            and thought this would be a great career for me. </p>
        <p>Outside of develping my hobbies include working out, watching Shows/Anime, or             just hanging out with friends. </p>
        <p>If you are looking for a devloper or would like to colab please reach out! I cant                wait to start working with other developers.</p>
